The "Light On/Off" project, represents a fundamental yet illustrative endeavor in web development. Crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project elegantly demonstrates the interplay between these technologies. The "index.html" file forms the backbone of the webpage's structure, while CSS lends visual appeal. With JavaScript, the project enables users to toggle a virtual light switch on and off. To explore the concept, launch the "index.html" file in a web browser. Inspired minds can seize the opportunity to expand the project's scope or refine its components, opening the door to deeper explorations in interactive web experiences.
