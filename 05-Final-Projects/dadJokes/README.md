The "Dad Jokes" project,  comprises files for a playful web application. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers a delightful way to enjoy classic dad jokes. The "index.html" file forms the structure of the webpage, while the CSS file provides styling, and the JavaScript file brings interactivity by fetching and displaying jokes from an API. To experience the joviality, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser. Embrace the humor and, if inclined, contribute enhancements or additional features to spread the laughter further.
