The "Rest Countries API Call" project, embodies a practical and educational exploration of web development. Developed using HTML and JavaScript, this project focuses on making API calls to retrieve and display information about countries. The "apicall.html" file serves as the foundation of the webpage's structure, while JavaScript leverages the Rest Countries API to fetch and showcase country data. To dive into the project, open the "apicall.html" file in a web browser. Feel free to experiment, enhance, or customize the project to delve deeper into the world of API integration and dynamic data presentation.
